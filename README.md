# Eleusis Bootstrap
This is bare minimum Visual Studio project for creating Eleusis GUI apps.

[Eleusis](https://github.com/bognikol/Eleusis) is work in progress; you are welcomed to contribute.

Download sample app [here](https://github.com/bognikol/Eleusis-Sample-App-Binaries).

## Requirements
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

## Current Major Limitations
* Eleusis may not work as expected when window size exceeds 1920 x 1200 effective pixels.
* Unfortunately, currently Eleusis passes STL objects through library boundary. It means that exact platform-configuration match of Eleusis dll needs to be used.
